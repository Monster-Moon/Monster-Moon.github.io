## Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent method.

- The stochastic gradient descent method is one of the most widely used for the online learning. The method is not only easy to implement, but also has good properties of the solution under homogeneous generating model.

- However, the stochastic gradient method can mislead the online-learning when the homogeneity isviolated because of bias of stochastic gradient. 

- For example, if there are two heterogeneous generating models in the observation, then the stochastic gradient might be bias estimator of gradient.

- I propose the an adaptive stochastic gradient method that mitigate the problem of the heterogeneous models which is a robust mini-batch optimization method using statistical tests and I investigate the convergence radius of the solution in the proposed method.
