## Learning multiple quantiles with neural networks.

- We present a neural network model to estimate multiple quantiles satisfying the non-crossing property. 
- We apply inequality constraints used in the developed non-crossing SVM model.
- In particular, to use the first-order optimization method, we develop a new method.
- In the algorithm, an auxiliary variable lying on the feasible set is introduced as a proxy of the model parameter. By regularizing the difference between the auxiliary and original parameters, our proposed algorithm achieves close to the optimal solution while avoiding the projected gradient step with polynomial computation to significantly improve the computational efficiency.
