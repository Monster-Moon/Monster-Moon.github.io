## Learning multiple quantiles with neural networks.

- The quantile regression model provides a richer characterization for the conditional distribution of for given explanatory variables.
 
- For multiple quantiles under finite samples, estimation errors lead to undesirable crossing problem which violate the basic property that cumulative distribution function is monotone increasing.

- I present a neural network model to estimate multiple quantiles satisfying the non-crossing property which employ inequality constraints used in the developed non-crossing SVM model.

- To use the first-order optimization method, an auxiliary variable lying on the feasible set is introduced as a proxy of the model parameter. By regularizing the difference between the auxiliary and original parameters, our proposed algorithm achieves close to the optimal solution while avoiding the projected gradient step to significantly improve the computational efficiency.
